Can we reverse a linked list in less than O(n) ?


No, we cannot reverse a linked list in O(n) time, because each pointer must be reversed or
values must be interchanged to reverse a linked list.
To do that we need to reach the last node which takes a pointer to
reach last node which takes O(n) time. It can`t even be done by using recursive and iterative methods.
